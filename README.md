Recently started moving to vim. Probably the best switch I've ever made. Here is my setup. Still a newbie and have to get used to a lot of things, so suggestions welcome.

I use Alacritty terminal emulator (without Tmux.)

Still need to work on the Vimtex and snippets setup. [(This beauty)](https://castel.dev/post/lecture-notes-1/)
